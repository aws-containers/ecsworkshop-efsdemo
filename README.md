## ECSWorkshop - EFS Demo

This repository is part of the ECS Workshop.

The purpose of this repo is to showcase how you can run a stateful container on ECS Fargate. We will be using EFS for the persistent storage layer that the containers will share and use.

Instructions on how to use the code in this repository can be found here: [https://ecsworkshop.com/stateful_workloads/](https://ecsworkshop.com/stateful_workloads/)
